# Tab Matrix
Firefox Extension for organizing tabs in two dimensions.

This extension lists groups horizontally in a sidebar while listing the current group's tabs horizontally in the tab bar. It also adds some keybindings and commands for easier group and tab management. This combines the best features of Firefox's vertical and horizontal tab modes.
